Traffic Simulator 
Authors - Harry W. & Shawn Johnson
Traffic Simulator is a final project for our data structures and algorithms class, with the goal of creating an operational intersection traffic simulator. Cars will spawn at random intervals and in random lanes,
and the goal of the code is to control the traffic lights and sensors in order to minimize the average wait time of the cars. The intersection will have a visual component that will display the cars as they move 
between lanes using graphics of cars and the environment.
